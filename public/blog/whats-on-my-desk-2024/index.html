            <p>I use a MacBook Pro as my main computer. It&rsquo;s served me <em>very</em> well for the past 7 months and I do not plan on upgrading or replacing it for possibly the next decade unless it breaks. I used to be quite anti-Apple, but since switching to a Mac, I finally understand why people love macOS; I can throw anything at it and it&rsquo;ll do it with no complaints, unlike Windows, which has gotten buggy and overly tedious to use, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Previously, I used a mid-range PC I built running Windows. That particular PC had its flaws but I loved it regardless. One thing I miss about using a PC is the ability to tinker and experiment with different operating systems, but I guess that&rsquo;s a compromise I have to make for a far better experience with my Mac.</p>
<p>I must say that I am, in no way, an Apple shill, nor am I a big-time fanboy. I just enjoy the products.</p>

<h3 id="keyboard-and-mouse">Keyboard and mouse</h3>
<p>My keyboard of choice is the Logitech G915. It&rsquo;s slim, with mechanical keys, and has full RGB. I had been previously using a cheaper &ldquo;Havit&rdquo; keyboard from Amazon, so this was a much needed upgrade.</p>
<p>For my mouse, I use the Logitech MX Master 3s. It&rsquo;s hands-down the best mouse I&rsquo;ve ever used in my life. It has great ergonomics, quiet and soft buttons, and works especially well with my MacBook.</p>
<p>Underneath those two, I have a dark blue leather desk mat that a relative of mine gave to me some time ago. It&rsquo;s easy to clean and matches the wall behind the desk.</p>
<h3 id="monitor">Monitor</h3>
<p>My monitor is the Dell UltraSharp U2721DE. I was eyeing up this particular one for its looks and USB hub functionality. I was shocked when I saw this exact model sitting on a shelf in my local CeX shop. I picked it up a few days later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 2560x1440, 60hz IPS panel with okay colour accuracy. When I had initially turned it on, it had a noticeable green tint that required me to manually change the colours in the options.</p>
<p>Because of how macOS handles display scaling for most resolutions, I had to install a third-party app called BetterDisplay to get my monitor to run at a high DPI.</p>
<h3 id="audio-interface">Audio interface</h3>
<p><img src="images/IMG_3316-scaled.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I use the Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd gen. It&rsquo;s works and does the job with absolutely zero hassle. I have not had one single problem. I got it a few years ago to replace the aging AKAI EIE Pro USB interface that had been given to me by my brother. That interface was very finicky and I felt like it was hit or miss on whether it would work or not.</p>
<h3 id="speakers">Speakers</h3>
<p>The PreSonus Eris E3.5 (mine are the first generation ones) are fantastic speakers / studio monitors especially considering the price compared to some other monitors out there. I like the adjustable bass and treble knobs on the back to be able to tailor it to your specific environment.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sitting on top of some Millenium Desktop Monitor Stands that came bundled with them. They aren&rsquo;t pictured since I don&rsquo;t have room for them on my desk at the moment. Anyway, they&rsquo;re height adjustable but pretty bulky and probably a bit overkill for those speakers.</p>
<h3 id="microphone">Microphone</h3>
<p>My microphone of choice in 2020 was the Samson Q2U. It&rsquo;s not really that exciting, it&rsquo;s just a microphone. It sounds decent and hasn&rsquo;t had any issues.</p>
<p>The arm is sitting on is a TONOR microphone boom arm. Works fine, although it needs a bit of a clean. It does squeak, and the springs make sound when they&rsquo;re being pulled, but I can&rsquo;t really complain considering how cheap it was.</p>
