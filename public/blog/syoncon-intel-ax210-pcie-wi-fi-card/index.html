            <p>I recently purchased the SYONCON AXE5400 PCIe Wi-Fi card with the Intel AX210 chip to replace the aging and unreliable Fenvi T919 card in my PC.</p>
<p>The packaging is very clean and professional looking, unlike other similarly priced cards from other manufacturers on Amazon.</p>
<p>The box includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A bag with screws to mount the card in place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screwdriver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two antennas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The card itself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instruction pamphlet in multiple languages</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Installing the card was a breeze, and installing the drivers was even easier. All I had to do was get the Intel wireless driver from their website, and install. It worked straight after.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screenshot-2024-08-31-at-17-38-34-Intel%C2%AE-Wi-Fi-6E-AX210-1024x592.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Using the internet with this was such a relief after having to deal with the slow and outdated Wi-Fi card I had previously.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Drivers are official and easy to find</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The card is easy to install</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Works natively on Linux</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bluetooth latency is great</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Included antennas are quite weak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bluetooth audio can be a bit flakey</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On average I get about 30-50mbps download, though I keep my desktop PC sitting next to my TV, which isn&rsquo;t exactly optimal for signal strength. Even with my PC sitting elsewhere, I don&rsquo;t always get full signal strength compared to my MacBook or iPhone.</p>
<p>Bluetooth audio works flawlessly apart from ocassional skipping and cutting out, but this also could be due to where I have my PC.</p>
<p>Support for the Intel chip was added in Linux Kernel version 5.10, so support out-of-the-box should be expected in any major distribution released within the last 4 years. For me, it worked straight away when using OpenSUSE Tumbleweed as of 30/08/24.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d highly recommend this card to anyone who does not currently have Wi-Fi on their PC, or they&rsquo;re looking for an easy solution to upgrade an older computer.</p>
