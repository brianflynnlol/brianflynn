            <p>A few weeks ago, I went to Butlers Chocolate Café right next to the new Shopping Centre in Bray Town Centre.</p>
<p>Walking in, I immediately noticed how small the Café was. There wasn&rsquo;t many places to sit and drink.</p>
<p>I had to ask about what options were available for me due to my wheat and peanut allergies. The person behind the counter recommended the hot chocolate. Normally, you would get a free chocolate with it but due to cross-contamination, I couldn&rsquo;t have one.</p>
<p>In my opinion, they should have them better separated for people like me with severe allergies.</p>

<p>The hot chocolate was very tall and pretty heavy. It had whipped cream and chocolate shavings on top. Right after the first sip, I noticed it was very rich and &ldquo;chocolatey&rdquo;. It was quite bitter and heavy on my stomach.</p>
<p>When I had finished it, my stomach was NOT enjoying it whatsoever. After we left, I had to go to the shop to buy a bottle of water.</p>
<p>I much, much prefer a more traditional hot chocolate from a place like Costa Coffee or Starbucks. Butlers was far too much.</p>
<p>Overall, I rate the hot chocolate from Butlers Chocolate Café a 4.5/10. Not my cup of tea, but I see how someone could enjoy it.</p>
<h1 id="update-5-march-2024"><strong>Update (5 March 2024):</strong></h1>
<p>I have since revisited Butlers, this time getting a takeaway latte. The coffee was quite strong and was scalding hot when I took my first sip. Despite that, it was still enjoyable. However, I&rsquo;m not changing my rating.</p>
