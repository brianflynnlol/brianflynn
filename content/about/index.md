## Site credits
This site is built with HTML, CSS and the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

The HTML and CSS code is done with help from [this tutorial from Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/learn/creating-hugo-themes) and ideas from Eric Murphy's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/ericmurphy.xyz).

It all helped with working out, cleaning up and polishing stuff!
