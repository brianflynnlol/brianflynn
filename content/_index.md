## Hi, I'm Brian.
Welcome to my little place on the internet. This is where I'll post blog posts about cool tech I get, share my opinion on tech-related subjects, and more!

Iâ€™m a 16-year-old tech enthusiast from Ireland. I have been fascinated with technology for over 11 years, having consumed tech-related media on YouTube, and eventually using it daily.
